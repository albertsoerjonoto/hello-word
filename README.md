# hello-word
I usually send codes to the master to push changes himself in group projects, but it's time to upload my personal projects as well!

Aim:
1. Start working on GitHub as also an online personal resume
2. Familiarize myself with Git for faster work on group projects

Hi readers!
I am Albert, I like building robots, especially autonomous unmanned vehicles.

I started at 9 with graphic programming, using Lego NXT as the framework to build and program robots such as Maze-Bot and Sumo-Bot. My first win in robotic competitions was in 2009, with a Golf-Bot that can navigate autonomously through a maze and play golf when it sees the ball.

Afterwards, I have been changing my frameworks to suit the project, from Arduino, Pi, to ROS. That's all for the sneak peak, time to continue the tutorials~
